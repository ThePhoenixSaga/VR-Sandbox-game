# VR Sandbox game
 This was part of my coursework from my masters. A VR sandbox game based in a literal sandbox. The objective is to find the means to throw the squiral out of the sandbox using the gemoetires available. This coursework was part of learning and developing VR using MiddleVR API in Unity.
